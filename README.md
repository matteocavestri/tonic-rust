# Rust tonic calculator

This repo helped me learn how to use tonic in rust. The repo is inspired by [Dreams Of Code](https://github.com/dreamsofcode-io). To run the gRPC server, execute

```bash
cargo run --bin server
```

To implement a frontend, use the one made by Dreams Of Code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dreamsofcode-io/grpcalculator-web.git
cd grpcalculator-web
npm i
npm run dev
```

The web server is reachable at port '5173'
